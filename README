Exam.py:

   It generates exam based on exam_structure from question database
   It has two modes:
     mode=1: Questions are selected based on individual difficulties. Enables if "target_overall_difficulty" variable is set to zero in "exam.py"
     mode=2: Questions are selected based on overall difficulty. It ignores difficulty column in "Exam_structure". Enables if "target_overall_difficulty" is bigger than zero.
   Output file name is "exam.tex". You can modify by changing "output_name" variable in exam.py


ExamStructure

  Qname: Keyword1,Keyword2: Difficulty

  Delimiter between fields is ": "
  Keywords-> Delimiter ","

template_tex:
  Modify as you wish but do not change "PACKAGESHERE" and "QUESTIONSHERE". 
  exam.py replaces QUESTONSHERE with texts of questions and PACKAGESHERE with required packages.

Questions:
  The default path of the question database is "./questions/" folder.
  You can select different path for question database by updating "pn_questions" variable in exam.py. If you are using Windows you have to modify this variable.
  
  Names of question files can be anything (single word to be on safe side).
  
  Question file format:
    Fieds: Difficulty/Keywords/Requiredpackages/Text.
    All fields have to be defined. Only "Requiredpackages" can be left empty.
    
    Except Requiredpackages,
    {FIELD: ...
    END}
    
    Delimiter for keywords is ", "
    
    {Requiredpackages:
       command1: argument1,argument2,argument3
       command2: argument4,argument5 
    END}   
     
    {Requiredpackages:
       usepackage: amsmath
       tikzlibrary: calc,positioning 
    END}
